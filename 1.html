- After the last update, there were issue where NEXON plates were not able to be earned, and we fixed it today since it did not require a build change.<br>
- To fix several gear issues created after the update, we processed a hot fix.<br>
Please update the game in the Steam Client to process properly.<br>
Thank you.<br><br>
